This also counts all the ballot images and compares with the cast-vote record file. This function creates the Ballot Information File (BIF).

log ",gen_bif
bia_actions,GenStyles,"Based on the BIF and any optional merged_style information, AuditEngine performs a number of discrete steps to generate information used in the extraction:

   1. gentemplate: combines multiple (usually 50) ballots of the same style to form templates with improved image resolution and clarity while suppressing random marks.

   2. genrois: analyze the templates to locate ""regions of interest"" -- ROIs) that represent contests and options, and do OCR on text within those regions. This step can perform this step in a graphics-first or OCR-first algorithm.

   3. maprois: map the contests and options based on information in the Election Information File (EIF). If style discovery is used with OCR-first genrois, no additional information is required, otherwise, if no cast vote record exists, a ""Manual Styles to Contests File"" (MSTC) is required. The MSTC file can be manually generated by reviewing the templates for each style and noting in the spreadsheet which contests are included in each style. This generates the ROISMAP which is the information used for extraction.

The result maprois is a set of ""redline"" proofs that should be reviewed for accuracy, and the map report, which discloses all the styles that have been correctly mapped and those that did not successfully map. ",,"templates_report

bia_actions,Extract Vote," This is the primary function of AuditEngine, extracting the vote from the ballot images. The result of this function is a set of ""marks"" data files that indicates the marks and also the calculated vote on a per-ballot basis. This function will spawn up to 1,000 virtual computers in parallel to recognize the vote on the ballots. ",,"extraction_report

bia_actions,Cmp CVR ," the extracted vote as determined by AuditEngine can be compared with the vote as provided in the CVR, if a ballot-by-ballot CVR is available. Otherwise, the function will compare with the overall totals of each contest in the election as provided in the Results file.  The result of this operation is a report of the overall totals of each contest, as determined by AuditEngine and compares with the official results. 

There are usually some unprocessed ballots that did not align properly by AuditEngine or otherwise could not be processed due to image defects, and there are disagreements on the vote on some ballots. If the margin of victory, in votes, is larger than the sum of the unprocessed ballots and disagreements, then the election is confirmed.  

However, if any contest is so close that the contest is not confirmed right away, then there are two steps that can be taken:  
    1. Investigate the reason that some of the ballots are not fully processed. These improvements may require enhancements to the algorithms used by AuditEngine to align the ballots even with poor quality images. This will require assistance from AuditEngine staff. If improvements are made, then Extract Vote can be re-launched. Otherwise, these can be treated as disagreements.  
    2. Adjudicate disagreements - If the contest is so close that it is not confirmed, then the disagreements (or unprocessed ballots) can be manually adjudicated. (See ""Adjudication"").",,"disagreements_report

bia_actions,Adjudication,"If any contest is so close that it is not confirmed, then the disagreements (or unprocessed ballots) can be manually adjudicated. This process is a function of the browser user interface, and it pulls up the disputed ballots one by one and the user enters the vote from that ballot by human inspection.  This process need only be performed as long as is necessary so that the contest(s) that did not confirm become significantly confirmed. As a worst case all disagreements and unprocessed ballots must be adjudicated.  The adjudication phase creates a JSON file which is the adjudicated vote. After adjudication is performed, it is not necessary to re-extract the vote, only the Cmp CVR operation.",,"adjudication_report
